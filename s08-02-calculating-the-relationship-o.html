    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p01">Financial calculation is not often a necessary skill since it is easier to use calculators, spreadsheets, and software. However, understanding the calculations is important in understanding the relationships between time, risk, opportunity cost, and value.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p02">To do the math, you need to know</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_l02">
        <li>what the future cash flows (CF) will be,</li>
        <li>when the future cash flows will be,</li>
        <li>the rate at which time affects value (e.g., the costs per time period, or the magnitude [the size or amount] of the effect of time on value).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p03">It is usually not difficult to forecast the timing and amounts of future cash flows. Although there may be some uncertainty about them, gauging the rate at which time affects money can require some judgment. That rate, commonly called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">discount rate</a><span class="glossdef">The effect of time on value or the rate at which time affects value; used when calculating the equivalent present value of a nominal future value.</span></span> because time discounts value, is the opportunity cost of not having liquidity. Opportunity cost derives from forgone choices or sacrificed alternatives, and sometimes it is not clear what those might have been (see <a class="xref" href="fwk-134226-ch02#fwk-134226-ch02">Chapter 2 "Basic Ideas of Finance"</a>). It is an important judgment call to make, though, because the rate will directly affect the valuation process.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p04">At times, the alternatives are clear: you could be putting the liquidity in an account earning 3 percent, so that’s your opportunity cost of not having it. Or you are paying 6.5 percent on a loan, which you wouldn’t be paying if you had enough liquidity to avoid having to borrow; so that’s your opportunity cost. Sometimes, however, your opportunity cost is not so clear.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p05">Say that today is your twentieth birthday. Your grandparents have promised to give you $1,000 for your twenty-first birthday, one year from today. If you had the money today, what would it be worth? That is, how much would $1,000 worth of liquidity one year from now be worth today?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p06">That depends on the cost of its not being liquid today, or on the opportunity costs and risks created by not having liquidity today. If you had $1,000 today, you could buy things and enjoy them, or you could deposit it in an interest-bearing account. So on your twenty-first birthday, you would have more than $1,000. You would have the $1,000 plus whatever interest it had earned. If your bank pays 4 percent per year (interest rates are always stated as annual rates) on your account, then you would earn $40 of interest in the next year, or $1,000 × .04. So on your twenty-first birthday you would have $1,040.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p11">The cost of delayed consumption is largely derived from a subjective valuation of whatever is consumed, or its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">utility</a><span class="glossdef">Value, including subjective or nonmarket value as well as objective or market value.</span></span> or satisfaction. The more value you place on having something, the more it “costs” you not to have it, and the more the time that you are without it affects its value.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-134226-ch04_s02_p12">Assuming that if you had the money today you would save it (as it’s much harder to quantify your joy from consumption), by having to wait to get it until your twenty-first birthday—and <em class="emphasis">not</em> having it today—you miss out on $40 it could have earned.</p>
